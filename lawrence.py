The chatbot leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to identify food items, estimate portion sizes, and assess macronutrient and micronutrient composition.
By evaluating food images, the chatbot helps users make informed dietary choices, track calorie intake, and maintain balanced nutrition. 
It can also provide tailored recommendations based on dietary goals, health conditions, or specific nutritional needs. This technology is particularly beneficial for individuals monitoring their diet, healthcare professionals, and organizations promoting nutrition awareness.""")
